The two directories CAT_MN_S-type and Rat_MN_F-type contain code from
our MN model files built with GENESIS. Considering that the kernel
part of the models is the definition of the active conductances, I
supplied the programs for the all active conductances with a file for the
definition of variables used in the models.

As an example of how to use this code I supplied one of our models for
public distribution five years ago in the SCM_Cat_dist folder. A brief
manual in a word (or openoffice) file describing usage of the model is
also attached. Please note that this model is not exactly the same as
the one published in J Physiol 544: 521-536, 2002. For examples, the
persistent sodium conductance (gNaP) was not included in the model,
and the more active conductances could be activated in axon and
dendrite compartments in this model. But it's a good tool for those
who are interested in learning and using the single cell model in
their studies.

...

Since there is only small modifications in the codes for the
definition of cell types (S, FF, & FR for cat MNs and S & F for rat
MNs), I selected an S-type of cat and a F-type of rat MNs.

The cat MN model was published in

Dai Y, Jones KE, Fedirchuk B, McCrea DA, Jordan LM (2002) A modelling
study of locomotion-induced hyperpolarization of voltage threshold in
cat lumbar motoneurones. J Physiol 544:521-36

and the rat MN model is published in

on alpha-motoneurones J Appl Physiol 10.1152/japplphysiol.00482.2006
